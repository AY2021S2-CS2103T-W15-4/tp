# Focuris

Focuris helps NUS Computing Students manage their schedules by being able to add events of different times and priorities. It is optimised for the CLI such that students are easily able to add new events easily and quickly.

## Value Proposition

- Adding of various different types of events with descriptions.
- Prioritise work based on priority level by labeling events as Low, Medium, or High priority.
- Split work into progressions such as Backlog, ToDo, In Progress, and Done.
- Get an overview via the List view so that you can find the event that you need easily.
- Quickly updating events on the go as you complete them.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
