## Project: Focuris

Focuris is a desktop event management application created with a Kanban board graphical user interface, which aims to help users better keep track of their tasks through an intuitive CLI, with a GUI created in JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature**: Added Event model into Focuris

  - What it does: This class is the backbone of all the events and tasks in Focuris
  - Justification: We require an Event class to encapsulate all the user operations to an event
  - Highlights: This affects all other commands added to Focuris in the future.
  - Testing: Added test cases and test factory for Events
