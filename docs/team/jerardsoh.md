## Project: Focuris

Focuris is a desktop event management application created with a Kanban board graphical user interface, which aims to help users better keep track of their tasks through an intuitive CLI, with a GUI created in JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature**: Added Priority tags to Events in Focuris

    - What it does: Allows the user to key in their preferred Priority (High, Medium, Low) to events in Focuris.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product because the user can now look at events and know what events to prioritise, which is useful for task management apps.
    - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands that adds an event and the edit command in Focuris.
    - Testing: Added and edited some test cases for Events to include EventPriority
