## Project: Focuris

Focuris is a desktop event management application created with a Kanban board graphical user interface, which aims to help users better keep track of their tasks through an intuitive CLI, with a GUI created in JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature**: Added the BackLog, Todo Commands.

  - What it does: Allows the user to add the two different kinds of events as stated above into the application.
  - Justification: We require those commands to encapsulate the addition of the different events into Focuris.
  - Highlights: This affects the logic and model components of Focuris in the future.
  - Testing: Added test cases and test factory for the commands written.

- **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kieron&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-02-19&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=zoom&zA=kieron560&zR=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&zACS=105&zS=2021-02-19&zFS=kieron&zU=2021-04-09&zMG=undefined&zFTF=commit&zFGS=groupByRepos&zFR=false)
