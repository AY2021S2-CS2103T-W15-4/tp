## Project: Focuris
Focuris is a desktop event management application created with a Kanban board graphical user interface, which aims to help users better keep track of their tasks through an intuitive CLI, with a GUI created in JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the 

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to switch views of the Events in Focuris.

  - What it does: Allows the user to switch between a list view of events and a Kanban Board view of events in Focuris.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view all their events in a list format, or choose to view their events in the format of a Kanban Board, which sorts the events by Todo, Backlog, in Progress, or Done.
  - Highlights: This enhancement extends Focuris as an application and affects any other extensions to the event class built in the future.
  - Testing: Added and edited some test cases for the Done command and Done command parser.
